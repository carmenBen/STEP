        <p><h5>Monopoly</h5>
          With a partner, I created an application mimicking the classic childhood game Monopoly. Using <span class="bold">Java</span> we were
          able to mimic game play from the process of rolling dice and moving around the board, to the process of buying properties, building
          houses(and hotels!), collecting rent from other players, and even ending up in jail! During this project, I was able to create the
          graphical user interface design and create the front end, as well as work on key back end features such as the act of buying properties
          and building houses on them.<br>

          <h5>Closet Organizer</h5>
          In a group of two, I created a closet organizer application using <span class="bold">Java</span>. Our application worked by having
          users upload photographs of clothing they owned, from their users could sort and filter items based categories of their choice. Users
          could also have outfits suggested to them, by selecting which "categories", for example "shirts" and "pants", to select items from. I
          contributed heavily to the front end design and code, as well as multiple back end features including the filtering feaures and uploading
          image feature.<br>

          <h5>Restaurant Review Site</h5>
          Using <span class="bold">Python</span>, I created a restaurant review website with a partner. Our website used a database of restaurants
          that allowed users to search restuarants, see relevant information, including location, size etc, as well as comment on these restaurants
          and rate them. Users could then filter and sort restaurants by their information and by their top aggregate rating from the site. My work
          on this site mostly focused on the code for filtering, and storing and displaying the data from the reviews.<br><br>
          <h5>Portfolio Website</h5>
          Created this entire portfolio website.<br><br>
