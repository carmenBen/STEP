        <p><strong>Monopoly</strong> With a partner, I created an application mimicking the classic childhood game Monopoly.
            Using Java we were able to mimic game play from the process of rolling a dice and moving around the board, to
            the process of buying properties, building houses(and hotels!), collecting rent from other players, and even ending up in jail! During
            this project, I was able to create the graphical user interface design and create the front end, as well as work
            on key backend features such as the act of buying properties and building houses on them.<br><br>
            <strong>Closet Organizer</strong> In a group of two, I created a closet organizer application using Java. Our application
            worked by having users upload photographs of clothing they owned, from their users could sort and filter items based categories of their choice.
            Users could also have oufits suggested to them, by selecting which "categories", for example "shirts" and "pants", to select items from. I
            contributed heavily to the front end design and code, as well as multiple backend features including the filtering feaures and uploading image feature.</p>

        <p><strong>Restaurant Review Site</strong> Using python, I created a restauarant review website with a partner. Our website used a database of
            restaurants that allowed users to search restuarants, see relevant information, including location, size etc, as well as comment on these restaurants
            and rate them. Users could then filter and sort restaurants by their information and by their top aggregate rating from the site. My work on this site
            mostly focused on the code for filtering, and storing and displaying the data from the reviews.<br><br>
            <strong>Portfolio Website</strong> Created this entire portfolio website.<br><br>
