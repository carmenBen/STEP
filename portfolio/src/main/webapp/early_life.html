          <h4>New York</h4>
          <p>I moved to New York City at the age of 14, just in time to begin ninth grade at Stuyvesant High School.
            I initially lived in the Financial District downtown, but after less than a year, moved to Hells Kitchen,
            near Columbus Circle. Being in the city that never sleeps brought a slew of new opportunities. I began to
            take advantage of the myriad of cheap concerts of up and coming artists, a favorite being Gavin James, as
            well as the occasional show at the world famous Madison Square Garden, like Adele! To view a more detailed
            New York map with some of my favorite places in the city click the button below.

        <div class="marker-info" id="sydney">
          <h4>Sydney</h4>
          <p>From the age of four to fourteen, I called Sydney home. I lived about 10 minutes out of the city, in the
            suburb of Greenwhich for most of that time. I attended North Sydney Girls High School from seventh through
            ninth grade(fun fact, Nicole Kidman also attended North Sydney Girls!). In 2014, my family moved to New York
            City.

          <h4>Manila</h4>
          <p>I was born in 1999, in Manila, Philippines. I have two brothers, one older and one younger.
            Fun fact, on my mom's side, I am one of 39 cousins! I lived in Manila, until I was four years old,
            at which point I moved to Sydney, Australia.

          <h4>Claremont</h4>
          <p>I began college at Harvey Mudd College in 2018. I have lived in Atwood Dorm for the past two years and plan on
            living there again this year. Located on the very edge of LA county, I like to go into the city every so often to
            watch concerts(some highlights have been seeing The Band Camino and The Wombats!). There are some great beaches
            near campus too, some favorites being Santa Monica and Huntingon beach(where they hold a yearly dog surfing
            competition).
