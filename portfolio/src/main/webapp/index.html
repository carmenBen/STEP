          Hi my name is Carmen! I am a 20 year old  living in New York City.
          I was born in the Philippines, but moved to Australia when I was four! 
          I lived in Sydney until I was 14, and then I moved to New York.
          I am a rising junior at Harvey Mudd College where I am a joint majoring
          in Computer Science and Math. I am concentrating(like a minor) in
          economics too. In my free time I enjoy reading, listening to music,
          and watching movies! I also love going to concerts.
