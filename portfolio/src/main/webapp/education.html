        <p><h5>College</h5>
          I am a current student at <span class="bold">Harvey Mudd College</span>, a member of the Claremont Colleges, where I will
          begin Junior year in the fall. I am majoring in <span class="bold">Computer Science/Math</span> and concentrating, similar
          to a minor, in <span class="bold">Economics</span>. Since arriving at Harvey Mudd, I have taken Computability and Logic,
          Data Structures and Program Development, Discrete Mathematics, and Principles and Practices in Computer Science. In these
          courses I have worked in a variety of languages including <span class="bold">C++, Java, and Python</span>. I am an active
          of KASAMA, the Filipino Club of the Claremont Colleges, and will continue serving as an <span class="bold">Executive Board
          Member</span> for the club this coming year, as I did this previous year. This coming year, I will also be the
          <span class="bold">Treasurer of Atwood Dorm</span>, the residence hall I have lived at for the past two years.<br><br>
          <h5>High School</h5>
          I attended <span class="bold">Stuyvesant High School</span> in New York City, where I earned a Regents Honors Diploma.
          I took AP Computer Science, as well as a year of introductory computer science, through which I became familiar with both
          Java and Python. I also was able to take AP Calculus BC, and AP Macro and Microeconomics during this time. While there, I
          participated in Student Government, through which I held the position of <span class="bold">Chief Auditing Officer</span>,
          as well as our Debate team, through which I qualified for the State Debate Championship, and was the <span class="bold">
          Vice President of the Homeless Coalition</span>, a student volunteer organization that aimed to help the Homeless in the city
          through volunteering and advocacy. I was also an active member in the dance community in the school, participating in the
          annual SING! musical for all four years(pictured on the left), as well as various dance showcases and also being a member of
          the varsity Cheerleading and Stunt teams.<br><br>
          <h5>Summer Programs</h5>
          In the summer of 2017, I attended <span class="bold">Harvard University's Precollege Program</span>, where I took the
          Introduction to Computer Programming class which taught in C. In the summer of 2016, I attended the <span class="bold">
          Pre-College Program at Barnard College</span>, where I took Psych 101 and Introduction to Neuroscience.</p>
