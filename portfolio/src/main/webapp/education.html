        <p><strong>College</strong> I am a current student at Harvey Mudd College, a member of the Claremont Colleges, where I will
            begin Junior year in the fall. I am majoring in Computer Science/Math and concentrating, similar to a minor, in Economics.
            Since arriving at Harvey Mudd, I have taken Computability and Logic, Data Structures and Program Development, Discrete Mathematics,
            and Principles and Practices in Computer Science. In these courses I have worked in a variety of languages including C++, Java, and Python.
            I am an active of KASAMA, the Filipino Club of the Claremont Colleges, and will continue serving as an Executive Board
            Member for the club this coming year, as I did this previous year. This coming year, I will also be the Treasurer of Atwood
            Dorm, the residence hall I have lived at for the past two years.<br><br>
            <strong>Summer Programs</strong> In the summer of 2017, I attended Harvard University's Precollege Program, where I took
            the Introduction to Computer Programming class which taught in C. In the summer of 2016, I attended the Pre-College Program
            at Barnard College, where I took Psych 101 and Introduction to Neuroscience.</p>

        <p><strong>High School</strong> I attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City, where I earned a Regents Honors Diploma.
            I took AP Computer Science, as well as a year of introductory computer science, through which I became familiar with
            both Java and Python. I also was able to take AP Calculus BC, and AP Macro and Microeconomics during this time.
            While there, I participated in Student Government, through which I held the position of Chief Auditing Officer, as well as our Debate team,
            through which I qualified for the State Debate Championship, and was the Vice President of the Homeless Coalition, a student volunteer
            organization that aimed to help the Homeless in the city through volunteering and advocacy. I was also an active member in the dance
            community in the school, participating in the annual SING! musical for all four years(pictured on the left), as well as various dance
            showcases and also being a member of the varsity Cheerleading and Stunt teams.</p>
