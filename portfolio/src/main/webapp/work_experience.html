        <p><strong>Tradeweb</strong> In the summer of 2019, I interned at Tradeweb in New York City. As a software engineer intern,
          I spend my time working with one other intern to create a real time web application for other employees to use.
          Using frameworks including Python, Jinja, Flask, and Bootstrap, I designed and created the front end of the application.
          Focusing on both product design and functionality, I was able to leverage direct access to the users of the application
          (other employees), to create designs focused on user experience. The application is still used by the employees today.
          In addition to this project, I was able to learn about the FinTech industry during this summer. One highlight of the summer
          was visiting NASDAQ headquarters and watching as the closing bell was rung.<br><br>
          <strong>Olelo</strong> During the summer of 2018, I interned at OleloHQ, a computer software startup based in Manila, Philippines. I worked with the
          15 person team on front end bug fixing, in ReactJS. Through this experience I was able to learn about tech startups not
          only from the programming perspective but also in terms of the business aspect as well. I also gained insight into
          how working in the tech industry is different to academic coding.</p>

        <p><strong>Tutoring</strong> In the past few years I have also gained a lot of experience in the realm of one on one tutoring. I have tutored students
          from kindergarten through to 12th grade, in both a volunteer and paid capacity, in a range of subjects from Mathematics
          and Chemistry to History and English. For the past two years I have worked as a College Application Mentor at Crimson Education,
          helping students with writing their college application essays by assisting with brainstorming through to editing and final touches.
          In this role I have also advised students through college interviews by administering mock interviews. To date, I have helped 14
          students through the college application process. I am extremely passionate about education and have learned a lot through all these roles.</p>
