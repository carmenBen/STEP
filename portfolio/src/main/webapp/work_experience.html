        <p><h5>Tradeweb</h5>
            <strong>SWE Intern</strong><br>
            In the summer of 2019, I interned at Tradeweb in <span class="bold">New York City</span>. As a software engineer intern, I spent my
            time working with one other intern to create a <span class="bold">real time web application</span> for other employees to use. Using
            frameworks including <span class="bold">Python, Jinja, and Flask</span> I designed and created the front end of the application.
            Focusing on both product design and functionality, I was able to leverage direct access to the users of the application (other
            employees), to create designs focused on <span class="bold">user experience</span>. The application is still used by the employees today.
            In addition to this project, I was able to learn about the <span class="bold">FinTech industry</span> during this summer. One highlight
            of the summer was visiting NASDAQ headquarters and watching as the closing bell was rung.<br><br>
            <h5>Olelo</h5>
            <strong>SWE Intern</strong><br>
            During the summer of 2018, I interned at OleloHQ, a computer software startup based in <span class="bold">Manila, Philippines</span>.
            I worked with the 15 person team on <span class="bold">front end bug fixing, in ReactJS</span>. Through this experience I was able to
            learn about <span class="bold">tech startups</span> not only from the programming perspective but also in terms of the business aspect
            as well. I also gained insight into how working in the tech industry is different to academic coding.<br><br>
            <h5>Tutoring</h5>
            In the past few years I have also gained a lot of experience in the realm of <span class="bold">one on one tutoring</span>. I have
            tutored students from kindergarten through to 12th grade, in both a volunteer and paid capacity, in a range of subjects from Mathematics
            and Chemistry to History and English. For the past two years I have worked as a <span class="bold">College Application Mentor</span> at
            Crimson Education, helping students with writing their college application essays by assisting with brainstorming through to editing and
            final touches. In this role I have also advised students through college interviews by <span class="bold">administering mock interviews</span>.
            To date, I have helped 14 students through the college application process. I am extremely passionate about education and have learned a lot
            through all these roles.</p>
